## Dataset

> I used public dataset of Titanic, I gather data after that I clean the data and made visualization to show my results.


## Summary of Findings

> There are 12 columns and maximum 891 rows. I will investigate the correlation between survived, age and gender. Age and gender features will help me to get an analysis. We can see that from 1 plot, many of travellers died, And most ages of travellers are between 20-40 ages. |For analysis We are operate data cleaning and find missing values, some of them we filled however we dropped also some data for productive analysis.We can see that people who are between 20-40 are survived more than others.We can see all information before we talked about correlation between survived, age and gender. More male were survived than female and people who were 20-40 ages also survived more than others.
